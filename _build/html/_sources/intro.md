```{tab-item} Things I learned
- The use of cite and bibliography syntax made for very easy referencing in this assignment. A very user friendly syntax.
- Admonitions are pretty cool and easy to use.
- Working with the command line has been a challenge throughout the course and this assignment. I have learned a lot in using the command line terminal and perhaps the most useful tool I learned in this course.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Linking a figure/image from a file to a workbook without showing a broken link. Took me a long time and trial and error to work this one out.  
- Working with section labels in the CV. I was unable to make the label links in the summary sections if the sections were tagged as headings using markdown or html sytnax.
- I have been confused throughout the course as to the proper use of gitignore, including in this assignment. Particularly, it has never been clear to me what gitignore files apply to local vs github repositories.
